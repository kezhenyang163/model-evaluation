Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?",  "subject":"college_biology",  "choices":[    "The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.",    "The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.",    "The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.",    "The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally."  ],  "answer":3}
